# lolreader

**Really rough, like top-lane-jax rough.** Anyway, lolreader is a python library for getting data from (LoLReplays)[http://www.leaguereplays.com/] (.lrf). Currently we relay generic data about a game instance, teams, and players. There are plans to add item info in the future. Stay tuned.
